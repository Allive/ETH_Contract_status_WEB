### [Main repo](https://github.com/Allive/ETH_Contract_status)
									
### PLANS
I will wait for any feedback to improve this potential platform 
The next steps in my opinion are:
1. Publish mobile app (80% done)
2. New tab for any tbtc transaction
3. Integration with metamask with "profile page" for listing maximum possible operations in your wallets
4. More open API for improving other contribution development  
5. Something else that you email me or as an issue on this repo...
